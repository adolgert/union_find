There is a nice Python logging class.
The Python unit testing class... Is that why the code will run any func you give it?

This style of if-then, on the same line, can sometimes cause confusion.
  if debug: print

3+ lines between functions.
Hard to figure out what np.where() returns. Maybe give an example.
If you always zip the loc, then zip it immediately.
get_uses() could be very inefficient if the data type is near the end of the data. Some way to read through all the data once only?

The .dat is from reading the Tiff and writing in np format?

Converting to the numpy.where() format converts from a raster image to an indexed image, and that's very expensive. Keep it a raster as long as possible. Simply using (a>1) returns an array from a where all values are greater than one, still a raster image. Similarly, a==3 is all places a is 3, still as a raster image.

It looks like R trees are fine, maybe R* or R+. Important to bulk load initial domains, so don't insert one-at-a-time.
